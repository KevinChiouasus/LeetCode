# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree
###### tags: `LeetCode` `Easy`

## 英文題目本身
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

Note:
```
All of the nodes' values will be unique.
p and q are different and both values will exist in the BST.
```

## 題目要求
找pq兩點最小共同parent
## 想法
就, 拿個temp指向root後, 開始看pq在哪, pq都比他大 temp往右跳, 反之亦然
當temp指到的值 : p <= temp <= q, 回傳temp

        }
        return root;
    }

Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: **O(N)**, where NN is the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the BST.

- Space Complexity: **O(N)**. This is because the maximum amount of space utilized by the recursion stack would be NN since the height of a skewed BST could be NN. 
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {

        // Value of current node or parent node.
        int parentVal = root.val;

        // Value of p
        int pVal = p.val;

        // Value of q;
        int qVal = q.val;

        if (pVal > parentVal && qVal > parentVal) {
            // If both p and q are greater than parent
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        } else if (pVal < parentVal && qVal < parentVal) {
            // If both p and q are lesser than parent
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        } else {
            // We have found the split point, i.e. the LCA node.
            return root;
        }
    }
}

- Time Complexity : **O(N)**, where NN is the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case we might be visiting all the nodes of the BST.

- Space Complexity : **O(1)**.

        int qVal = q.val;

        // Start from the root node of the tree
        TreeNode node = root;

        // Traverse the tree
        while (node != null) {

            // Value of ancestor/parent node.
            int parentVal = node.val;

            if (pVal > parentVal && qVal > parentVal) {
